##Coding Assignment

Please complete the assignment and return. This form should allow a user to view a list of available appointment times and to select one. Your solution does not need to connect to a database, nor does it need to permanently store the selected appointment time. You must use the following technologies:

•             NodeJS

•             ReactJS or similar Javascript framework

•             The Flux pattern (if using React)

  

This application should exhibit best practices for application development where possible. 

 npm 

Application Requirements:

1.            Using the Flux pattern and ReactJS, build a screen which shows a list of hour long slots from 9am to 5pm.

2.            When one time slot is clicked, pop up a modal which asks for name and phone number.

3.            When the name and phone number is submitted, the time slot selected should change to red, indicating the time slot is no longer available.

4.            If the red time slot is clicked on again, the modal will pop up with the name and phone number for that appointment pre-populated. Users will be able to edit the name and phone number to change the user for the appointment.

 

Completion:

Please check in your code into a repository we can access – Git, etc. and send an email to your Recruiter saying it is complete. We'll take a look and ask some questions at the selected interview block.
